# seikomasterclock
ESP32 Seiko Master Clock Emulator

## Introduction

This project is intended for driving Seiko marine slave clocks that have a forward and reversing coils. The clocks expect a 24VDC pulse every 30 seconds of alternating polarity. This is achived by using an ESP32 for the clock functions which drives an L298N H-bridge that handles the 24VDC power switching.

## Features

- Button inputs for forwarding and reversing the clock in hours and half minutes
- NTP time syncronisation over WiFi
- Can drive hundreds of Seiko slave clocks

## TODO

- DST detection and automatic forwarding/reversing of the clocks
- General clean-up of code base

## Disclaimer
This project is in the early alpha stage, the driver works but long time stability hasn't been tested (rudimentary drift compensation has been done, but it's probably not even close to perfect). Use the included code at your own risk.
